    :fontawesome-regular-hourglass-half: It may take some time to download and setup Ozone for the first time.

Gitpod will automatically launch a new browser tab for OpenMRS 3.

You can navigate to other Ozone apps of the HIS via the `PORTS` tab of the Terminal panel in the Gitpod editor:

In Gitpod each app of the HIS will require you to log in separately with their own credentials:
