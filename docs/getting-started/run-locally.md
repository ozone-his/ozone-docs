## Download and start

Running the Ozone demo locally takes just three terminal commands:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozone-his/ozone/main/scripts/install-stable.sh | bash /dev/stdin
```

```bash
cd ozone/run/docker/scripts/
```

```bash
./start-demo-with-sso.sh
```

!!! warning ""

    :fontawesome-regular-hourglass-half: It may take some time to download and setup Ozone for the first time.

## Browse
Once started, the script will output the URLs to access the HIS apps and services:

For example:

![Ozone services started](../assets/images/run-locally-list-services.png)

Accessing any of those URLs should present you the Single Sign-On portal page:

![SSO login page](../assets/images/sso-login.png)

Log in to the demo using username **jdoe** and password **password**.

You're ready to start browsing Ozone üëè !

    üõ†Ô∏è If you encounter an error when trying to access OpenMRS specifically, you may need to apply the following command to force a restart of the OpenMRS service.
    ```curl
    docker restart ozone-openmrs-1
    ```
## Shut down the server

Once you're done browsing Ozone, you can destroy the server to keep your environment clean.

```bash
./destroy-demo.sh
```
