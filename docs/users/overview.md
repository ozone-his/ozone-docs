## 1) A suite of opt in/out digital health software

Ozone is a ready-to-use solution, providing a pre-selected array of FOSS[^foss] components that function seamlessly together.

It is a complete health information system allowing users to customize it by choosing which supported digital health software to include or exclude.

[^foss]:  Free and open-source software

### Current Ozone HIS suite

| **HIS type** | **Component**   | **Version**     |                |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| EMR          | OpenMRS         | `3.0.0-beta.18` |                |
| LIMS         | SENAITE         | `2.1.0`         |                |
| ERP          | Odoo            | `14.0`          |                |
| BI           | Apache Superset | `3.1.0`         |                |
| IdP          | JBoss Keycloak  | `22.0.0`        | {==:oz: Pro==} |

!!! tip "Ozone Pro markers"

    Features and sections exclusive to Ozone Pro are marked with &nbsp;&nbsp;{==:oz: Pro==}.

## 2) An interoperability framework

Ozone is powered by an interoperability EIP[^eip] framework that orchestrates seamless data flows between health information system components — EMR, LIMS, pharmacy, accounting, BI, and more.

[^eip]: Entreprise integration patterns

!!! example

    Clinicians' drug orders in the EMR system automatically generate items on the patient bill.

!!! example
    
    Lab results entered into the LIMS by lab staff are immediately visible to clinicians in the EMR system.

!!! example "Example &nbsp;&nbsp; {==:oz: Pro==}"

    Data analysts can perform real-time cross-analysis of clinical and billing data on the BI platform.

## What Ozone is not

Ozone is <u>not a fork</u> of other open-source projects; it utilizes standard, untouched components.

[^lts]: Long-term support

Ozone packages the latest LTS[^lts] versions of its components 'as-is'. Therefore it is not liable for any bugs, deficiencies, or performance issues in the bundled LTS versions of its components; these fall outside the purview of Ozone.

!!! tip

    We generally do not document Ozone’s components. Instead we refer to their own official documentation as much as possible.
