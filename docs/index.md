    This section of the Ozone Docs is designed for **digital health technical implementers**, focusing on how to install, configure, and run the Ozone HIS.

# Quick Start

??? question "Did you check the online demo? :thinking:"

    Before diving into the Quick Start or implementer guides, visit [our website]({{ homepage }}) and click **Try Demo** to explore the official Ozone Pro online demo.

=== ":fontawesome-solid-location-dot: Locally"

    Only three commands in a terminal:

    ```bash
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozone-his/ozone/main/scripts/install-stable.sh | bash /dev/stdin
    ```

    ```bash
    cd ozone/run/docker/scripts/
    ```

    ```bash
    ./start-demo.sh
    ```

    !!! warning ""

        :fontawesome-regular-hourglass-half: It may take some time to download and setup Ozone for the first time.

    Then, start browsing Ozone. This requires you to log into each app of the HIS separately:
