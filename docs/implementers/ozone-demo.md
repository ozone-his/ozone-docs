The **Ozone Demo** is an opinionated showcase of a typical HIS built using Ozone.

It offers a realistic view of the end-user experience, but doesn't cover the full range of customizations and possibilities available for addressing specific real-world use cases.

We have created a Getting Started guide to help you explore the demo through:

- Browsing the online {==:oz: Pro==} demo
- Running Ozone FOSS locally
- Running Ozone FOSS in Gitpod

    ⚡️ Open the [**Getting Started**](../getting-started/online-demo.md) section to continue. ⚡️

When you're ready, return to these Implementer docs to learn how to further adopt and customize Ozone for your specific needs.
