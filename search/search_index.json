This approach ensures that you can consistently replicate your production (or soon-to-be production) instance at any time. By adopting this practice, you gain the flexibility to create multiple environments for various purposes, including development, testing, demonstration, and training, without relying on or anonymizing a production database. Furthermore, this method empowers implementers to maintain full control over the configuration, enhancing overall system management and reproducibility.</p> <p>Within the skeleton project generated by the Ozone Maven Archetype, you'll find a <code>configs/</code> directory. This directory is organized into subfolders, each corresponding to a component of the Ozone HIS distribution.</p> <p>By default, the <code>configs/</code> directory contains only the <code>openmrs/</code> sub-folder as an example. However, as you progressively add more configurations, it will gradually expand to include one folder for each enabled app in your Ozone distribution.

You can do this by exporting directly in your shell (e.g. <code>export ENABLE_SSO=true</code>) or set them in a <code>.env</code> file. The environment variables set in the <code>.env</code> file will be automatically picked up by Docker Compose when you run the Docker Compose files and will be available to all containers. Below are the environment variables that you need to set:</li> </ul> Environment Variable Example value Description <code>ENABLE_SSO</code> <code>true</code> Toggle SSO, enable or disable. <code>SERVER_SCHEME</code> <code>https</code> Scheme used in generated URLs (<code>http</code> or <code>https</code>). <code>O3_HOSTNAME</code> <code>example.com</code> Hostname for the OpenMRS application. <code>ODOO_HOSTNAME</code> <code>erp.example.com</code> Hostname for the Odoo application. <code>SENAITE_HOSTNAME</code> <code>lims.example.com</code> Hostname for the SENAITE application. <code>KEYCLOAK_HOSTNAME</code> <code>auth.example.com</code> Hostname for the Keycloak identity provider. <code>OPENMRS_CLIENT_ID</code> <code>dfcbd981-6c46-46f8-8688-8e99166148fa</code> Keycloak client ID for OpenMRS. <code>OPENMRS_CLIENT_SECRET</code> <code>3335594e-57ec-4211-832d-774ce20ace58</code> Keycloak client secret for OpenMRS. <code>ODOO_CLIENT_ID</code> <code>9170108c-fdf0-4d7e-ad0a-f485c98a3390</code> Keycloak client ID for Odoo. <code>ODOO_CLIENT_SECRET</code> <code>362b43fe-6c80-41c9-9c0b-a60326480d60</code> Keycloak client secret for Odoo. <code>SENAITE_CLIENT_ID</code> <code>61a4c136-3658-4563-a986-415830551ea3</code> Keycloak client ID for SENAITE. <code>SENAITE_CLIENT_SECRET</code> <code>b70bcd8a-f75d-4598-8ff1-8be5db855fb6</code> Keycloak client secret for SENAITE. <code>OAUTH_CLIENT_ID</code> <code>56ac6ccf-004e-441f-a98b-8de7159f6ce9</code> OAuth client ID used by EIP Clients <code>OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET</code> <code>043c6292-4f9b-4c8e-85ed-3172f43ae4ff</code> OAuth client secret. <code>OAUTH_CLIENT_SCOPE</code> <code>email,profile,openid</code> OAuth scopes requested during authentication. <code>OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_URL</code> <code>https://auth.example.com/realms/ozone/protocol/openid-connect/token</code> Token endpoint URL for obtaining access tokens from Keycloak. <p>Note</p> <p>The above values are examples. Replace them with your actual domain names and client credentials.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>If Git or any version control is enabled for your project, ensure that sensitive files such as <code>.env</code> (containing secrets or credentials) are excluded from version control to protect sensitive information. This is to avoid accidental exposure of sensitive information.</p> <ul> <li>Use Docker Compose files that include the required SSO configurations. In Ozone, this means using the dedicated Keycloak file (<code>docker-compose-keycloak.yml</code>) along with application-specific files ending in <code>*-sso.yml</code> (for example, <code>docker-compose-openmrs-sso.yml</code> for OpenMRS). These files are provided in the Ozone package under <code>&lt;your-distribution&gt;/run/docker/</code>.</li> <li>First, navigate to the correct directory (<code>&lt;path-to-your-distribution&gt;/run/docker/</code>), or ensure you provide full paths to the Docker Compose files. Then, run Docker Compose with the required files. For example: <pre><code>cd &lt;path-to-your-distribution&gt;/run/docker/\n\ndocker-compose -f docker-compose-common.yml -f docker-compose-keycloak.yml -f docker-compose-openmrs.yml -f docker-compose-openmrs-sso.yml -f docker-compose-odoo.yml -f docker-compose-odoo-sso.yml -f docker-compose-senaite.yml -f docker-compose-senaite-sso.yml up -d\n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>Alternatively, use the <code>start-with-sso.sh</code> or <code>start-demo-with-sso.sh</code> scripts provided in the project. Follow the instructions in Run Locally to download and start Ozone locally with SSO enabled. The scripts will set the necessary environment variables and include the appropriate Docker Compose files, which mount the required SSO binaries and configuration files as volumes.</p>"},{"location":"implementers/enable-sso/#run-without-sso","title":"Run Without SSO","text":"<p>To run your distribution without SSO, simply set the <code>ENABLE_SSO</code> environment variable to <code>false</code> or leave it unset. Then, use the standard Docker Compose files without the SSO-specific files (any file with <code>-sso</code> suffix).

This means users will log in directly to each application using their individual login pages. Ozone allows you to easily switch between SSO and non-SSO modes by adjusting the <code>ENABLE_SSO</code> environment variable and the Docker Compose files used to start the services. The applications will adapt accordingly based on the presence or absence of SSO configurations.</p> <p>Ozone comes with default values for all the required environment variables to run without SSO. However, you can still set custom values for other environment variables (like hostnames and passwords) as needed.</p> <p>Using the provided <code>start.sh</code> or <code>start-demo.sh</code> scripts will automatically run Ozone without SSO by default. These scripts set the necessary environment variables and include the standard Docker Compose files without SSO configurations. </p> <p>It is important to note that Ozone does not support enabling or disabling SSO on-the-fly while the services are running. Changes to the SSO configuration require a rebuild of the distribution with the appropriate settings, then rerun the Docker Compose setup to apply the changes. This doesn't only apply to enabling or disabling SSO but also to any changes in the distribution.</p> <p>Did you know?</p> <p>Ozone  Pro comes with Central Auth! Without central authentication, user roles from each app are not available in Keycloak. Central Auth enables synchronizing roles from all apps into Keycloak for unified access control and assignation.

Closed-source software is accommodated within the Pro edition of Ozone or through custom developments.  Released version Must Ozone supports HIS flows between versioned software apps with stable and, ideally, well-documented APIs.  OAuth 2 Must OAuth2 is required for enhanced security and to implement SSO within the Ozone HIS.  Security updates Must Must undergo regular security audits (e.g. pen tests) and have a clear process for broadcasting the availability of security updates.  Docker image Should Docker, while not the sole deployment mechanism supported, is currently the default one in Ozone HIS.  Automated configurability Should Apps should be configurable through deployment processes, allowing for automated setup and initialization (specifically of master data) by placing configuration files in the appropriate locations.  Health check Should It is crucial that each app includes a web endpoint to let Ozone verify it is operational within the HIS.  Privacy &amp; Legal Compliance Should Should comply with relevant privacy, domestic, and applicable international laws. This may include data protection regulations.  Prometheus metrics Should Providing Prometheus metrics is recommended to enhance monitoring and ensure effective system performance management.  Backup &amp; restore Should Automated backup and restore capabilities ensure data integrity and system resilience in production use.  Internationalization Should Internationalization should be a first class citizen for any software. It ensures that it can be easily adapted to various languages and regions, making it accessible and usable by a global audience.  Modularity Should Modularitiy enables potential enhancements or modifications to be made via modules, plugins, or addons without affecting the core software of the app.  HL7 FHIR API Should Providing HL7 FHIR API reduces development overhead for point-to-point apps routes within the Ozone HIS.
